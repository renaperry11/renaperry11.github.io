        <h5>Number of Crimes in Philadelphia Districts</h5>
        <p>This visualization shows the number of crime incidents reported in each Philadelphia Police District between January 1, 2025, and April 14, 2025. District 2 recorded the least number of crime incidents with 3,690. On the other hand, districts 6 and 10 in the northeast reported the highest number of crimes, with a total of 8,555. The crimes reported in each district come from Philadelphia Police District data, and include all crimes from thefts, burglaries, and DUIs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, northeast Philly is the most policed and busiest section of the city. The districts that make up the Northeast include neighborhoods that are notorious for crime and violence, like North Philadelphia, Port Richmond, and Kensington.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The areas with the highest number of crimes reported are also the most populated, with trends of increasing gentrification and new housing availability.

        <h5>Total Crime Trends</h5>
        <p>This chart shows the specific number of total crimes reported in each section of Philadelphia. The southern section of the city recorded the least number of crimes, with a total of 3,690. There are several factors that contribute to the stark difference in crime totals in each section of the city, including socioeconomic factors, demographics, and policing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example, South Philly generally experiences lower crime rates due to a combination of such factors. The sense of community and investment in neighborhood well-being is strong, leading to less violent crime and petty theft. Similarly, the high percentage of home ownership and effective policing leads to a decreased crime rate. These factors deter criminals and effectively create a stable environment for locals. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Four sections of the city, Central, East, Northwest, and Southwest, are closer in total crime numbers. The population density among these neighborhoods is very similar and historical factors, like segregation and gentrification, all impacted these areas and contributed to the steady crime rate.</p>

        <h5>Breakdown by Crime Type</h5>
        <p>This chart displays the total number of incidents by type. The most common, specific crimes reported by the Philadelphia Police Department are “Thefts,” “Motor Vehicle Thefts” and “Vandalism/Criminal Mischief”. In urban landscapes like Philadelphia, crimes like these are most common because they can happen quickly without confrontation or thorough planning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the Philadelphia Police Department, activities such as graffiti, breaking windows, and damaging public property are categorized under “Vandalism/Criminal Mischief”. In a densely populated area, crimes like these are low-risk and are not punished as severely as other crimes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most popular narratives about Philadelphia on social media is that the city suffers from high rates of gun violence, homicides, and other violent crimes like rape. In actuality, the data shows that Philadelphia had a 17% decrease in total violent crimes this year compared to 2024.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although most people believe this decrease in violent crime is due to increased patrolling and incarceration, Krasner argues that locking people up does not lower crime numbers. He claimed that "There has been a false narrative for too long in the county and in this city that the only way to have safety is to eliminate freedom… And yet, you see this level of safety.” In Philadelphia County, Krasner said that in past years, the number of people kept in county jails was up to 11,000. However, this year there are around 4,000, and therefore violent crime rates are significantly lower.

        <h5>Crimes Reported on Super Bowl Sunday 2025</h5>
        <p>The city of Philadelphia and Philadelphians in general are often portrayed as dangerous and violent by popular media outlets around the country. More specifically, many believe that when Philadelphia sports teams win (or lose), the city will be “burnt down” due to the rowdiness of fans. On the contrary, this data shows that Super Bowl Sundays in Philadelphia have seen reduced criminal activity, particularly when the Eagles are involved. </p> 
<br>
         <p>In fact, crime on the day of the Super Bowl was the lowest of any 24-hour period in 2025 so far as of Feb. 15, with 249 incidents between 5 a.m. Sunday and 5 a.m. Monday. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel also claims that “When you have an event with a magnitude like the parade and you have so much goodwill and so much positive energy, that has a significant impact on the city.”</p>

        <h5>Super Bowl Sunday Continued</h5>
        <p>Crime numbers in Philadelphia peak around 8 p.m. on weekends outside of Center City, but because millions of people stayed inside to watch the big game, with a general slowdown in street activity, there was a significantly calmer city environment. Bethel added, ”It really keeps people inside,” he said. “And that obviously is extremely helpful. There’s a combination of factors.”

        </p>
    <br>
      <p>
          This year, Super Bowl Sunday in Philadelphia saw a shift in criminal activity and patterns. The most common offenses were minor, including petty theft, vandalism, and criminal mischief. Violent crimes, gun-related incidents, and homicides were significantly lower, with only 8 “Aggravated Assault [with a] Firearm” incidents reported that day.

        <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
        <p>Philadelphia's crime landscape is complex, shaped by decades of shifting populations, socioeconomic factors, policing strategies, and media narratives. While some neighborhoods, like those in the Northeast, continue to struggle with high crime rates, this data shows promising signs of change — including a notable decrease in violent and gun-related crimes in 2025.</p>

    <br>
    <p>
          The data and these visualizations reveal that crime is not evenly distributed and cannot be understood through false narratives and media headlines. Instead, it’s tied to infrastructure, access to resources, and historical patterns of racial and economic disparity. As the city continues to evolve in 2025, this data proves that it is a foundation for more informed conversations about public safety, policing, and reporting.
