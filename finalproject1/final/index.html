        <h5>Number of Crimes in Philadelphia Districts</h5>
        <p>This visualization shows the number of crime incidents reported in each Philadelphia Police District between January 1, 2025, and April 14, 2025. District 2 recorded the least number of crime incidents with 3,690. On the other hand, districts 6 and 10 in the northeast reported the highest number of crimes, with a total of 8,555. The crimes reported in each district come from Philadelphia Police District data, and include all crimes from thefts, burglaries, and DUIs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, northeast Philly is the most policed and busiest section of the city. The districts that make up the Northeast include neighborhoods that are notorious for crime and violence, like North Philadelphia, Port Richmond, and Kensington.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The areas with the highest number of crimes reported are also the most populated, with trends of increasing gentrification and new housing availability.

      <h5>Total Crime Trends</h5>
      <p>This chart shows the specific number of total crimes reported in each section of Philadelphia. The southern section of the city recorded the least number of crimes, with a total of 3,690. There are several factors that contribute to the stark difference in crime totals in each section of the city, including socioeconomic factors, demographics, and policing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For example, South Philly generally experiences lower crime rates due to a combination of such factors. The sense of community and investment in neighborhood well-being is strong, leading to less violent crime and petty theft. Similarly, the high percentage of home ownership and effective policing leads to a decreased crime rate. These factors deter criminals and effectively create a stable environment for locals. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Four sections of the city, Central, East, Northwest, and Southwest, are closer in total crime numbers. The population density among these neighborhoods is very similar and historical factors, like segregation and gentrification, all impacted these areas and contributed to the steady crime rate.</p>

      <h5>Breakdown by Crime Type</h5>
      <p>This chart displays the total number of incidents by type. The most common, specific crimes reported by the Philadelphia Police Department are “Thefts,” “Motor Vehicle Thefts” and “Vandalism/Criminal Mischief”. In urban landscapes like Philadelphia, crimes like these are most common because they can happen quickly without confrontation or thorough planning. More specifically, motor vehicle thefts happen often in busy areas where unattended property is targeted and vulnerable.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>According to the Philadelphia Police Department, activities such as graffiti, breaking windows, and damaging public property are categorized under “Vandalism/Criminal Mischief”. In a densely populated area, crimes like these are low-risk and are not punished as severely as other crimes. There are also more opportunities to commit these crimes in areas where policing is low and economic challenges are high.
